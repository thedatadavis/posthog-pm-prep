### About PostHog

We're shipping [every product that companies need](https://posthog.com/handbook/why-does-posthog-exist) to run their business from their first day, to the day they IPO, and beyond. The operating system for folks who build software.

We started with open-source product analytics, [launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort](https://posthog.com/handbook/story). We've since shipped [more than a dozen products](https://posthog.com/products), including:

*   [A built-in data warehouse](https://posthog.com/docs/data-warehouse), so users can query product and customer data together using custom SQL insights.

*   [A customer data platform](https://posthog.com/docs/cdp), so they can send their data wherever they need with ease.

*   [PostHog AI](https://posthog.com/ai), an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries.

Next on the roadmap are CRM, workflow, revenue analytics, and support products. When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it!

We are:

1.   **Product-led**. More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit.

2.   [**Default alive**](https://paulgraham.com/aord.html). Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on.

3.   **Well-funded.** We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top [investors](https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/investors). We're set up for a long, ambitious journey.

We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and [being as weird as possible](https://posthog.com/deskhog).

### Product at PostHog

[Product management plays a slightly different role at PostHog](https://posthog.com/handbook/product/product-team) than at most other companies and is incredibly important. Instead of micro-managing engineers, PMs are responsible for **research**, **data**, and **setting high-level context** across the organization. [They work across multiple products](https://posthog.com/handbook/product/product-team#small-team-membership) to determine how products are being used, what the competitive landscape is like, and how users are feeling about PostHog. Using the usual PM jargon we could say PMs at PostHog are very [discovery-focused and don’t engage in delivery](https://www.svpg.com/discovery-vs-delivery/) almost at all.

Among other things, they:

1.   Run [growth reviews](https://posthog.com/handbook/product/per-product-growth-reviews) for products that have product-market-fit

2.   Dive into data research projects to answer challenging questions without obvious answers

3.   Organize [user interviews](https://posthog.com/handbook/product/user-feedback)

4.   Provide just-in-time product feedback for new and existing features, following our principles of shipping and iterating quickly

5.   Coach product engineers on ["how to do product](https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-engineering)"

### What you will be doing:

You will be joining PostHog as a Product Manager, working with one of our [small engineering teams](https://posthog.com/teams) (with the potential to cover more than one team/product after your onboarding period), with a heavy emphasis on **analyzing data**, **talking to users and owning the commercial aspects of your product(s)**:

*   We have a [growth review](https://posthog.com/handbook/product/per-product-growth-reviews) with every product every month. As the PM, you ensure we have the right metrics, dig into things that have changed, understand what users are doing, why they're churning, etc. You use the findings to figure out if we need to dig deeper into a trend or reprioritize what we're building.

*   Across our [10+](https://posthog.com/pricing) products (and counting!), we have thousands of paying customers and many more on the free tier. That’s a lot of users and a lot of data. Finding actionable patterns in this data is one of the key ingredients to reaching [$100M ARR](https://posthog.com/handbook/future). Example questions you might be answering:

    *   How does revenue/usage churn for your product compare across different segments?

    *   Which behaviours lead to long-term retention for your product?

*   You keep an eye on the commercial side of things. Each of our products is competing with incumbents multiple times bigger both in revenue and employee size. You will lead the research into our competitors and the tooling landscape, and provide recommendations where we have the biggest untapped potential, whether it’s pricing, feature parity or even spinning out an adjacent product

*   Things you choose to pick up. This could be a data deep dive outside the scope of the repeating growth reviews. Or figuring out how to package and price a new product that we want to perform better in terms of usage or revenue. Or it could be rubber-ducking the engineers to help them figure out the UX for a new product concept. **This is a highly autonomous role, and you’re expected to figure out where it makes the most sense to spend your time.**

### What you won’t be doing:

❌ Backlog grooming (it always sounded gross anyway)

❌ Deciding or approving what we build (though you’ll help surface the context needed to make good decisions)

❌ Shielding developers from users (instead, you should aim to invite an engineer for every user interview you do)

❌ Project management / writing gazillions of tickets, RFCs, or PRDs

❌ Coding and shipping new features yourself (small PRs and hackathon contributions are of course encouraged!)

### You’ll fit right in if:

*   You’ve been **a technical founder or product engineer** in a startup: We are explicitly looking for **someone who has written code before** and now wants to focus on the product and commercial side

*   You have **strong product sense** - meaning you can identify a product’s biggest selling points and weaknesses (both user experience and commercial) and turn them into actionable insights that inform your team’s product decisions

*   You’re**familiar with business and product metrics** (e.g. activation, retention, churn) and defining and tracking key product metrics. **You don’t hesitate to write SQL** (or another query language) to answer data questions

*   You’re very proactive/organized, so **you don’t wait to be told what to do**. Instead, you figure out what needs to happen, make it happen and keep multiple threads moving forward without letting things slip

*   You **collaborate well**as you default to transparency, share early, and seek feedback from the team and customers in an async-first world. **Strong communication skills** are the key to strong collaboration.

Nice-to-haves (We don’t expect you to tick all of these boxes, but 2-3 are a big plus):

*   You’ve done a decent portion of interviewing users already. And looking at additional product management experience, you might have even worked with designers or engineers on new user experiences?

*   You have additional data modelling experience on top of writing queries.

*   You’ve worked on a developer tool or AI product before.

If this sounds like you, we should talk.

We are committed to ensuring a fair and accessible interview process. If you need any accommodations or adjustments, please let us know.
