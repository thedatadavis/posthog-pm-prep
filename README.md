## Key Frameworks to Internalize

### 1. The ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
**High-growth startups, 15-500 employees, post-PMF, engineering-led**

This drives EVERY product decision at PostHog.

***

### 2. The PM's Role
**Context-setter, not roadmap dictator**

You provide intelligence (market, customer, data, competitive) so autonomous engineering teams make better decisions.

***

### 3. The Integration Moat
**Workflow consolidation > feature parity**

PostHog wins by reducing context-switching across analytics, debugging, experimentation, and customer intelligence—not by having the most features.

***

### 4. Per-Product Activation
**Each product has unique activation criteria**

Universal activation doesn't exist. Product Analytics ≠ Session Replay ≠ LLM Analytics. Memorize activation criteria for your target products.

***

### 5. Multi-Product Retention Driver
**Customers using 3+ products have 2-3x higher retention**

The goal is product breadth, not depth. Integration value compounds.

## Bonus Tool: VelocityGrid

<img width="591" height="569" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04fb3f76-1b5a-4f43-bf53-dc3d2507a32d" />

The **VelocityGrid** is a visual diagnostic tool designed to map the "health" of a product team's output. Unlike a Jira backlog or a Gantt chart—which track *what* is being done and *when*—this tool tracks **value and efficiency**.

**Interactive Tool:** [https://vel.pgpln.app/](https://vel.pgpln.app/)

**Explainer**: [velocity-grid.md](/velocity-grid.md)

It answers the two most critical questions in product management:
1. **Did it matter?** (Impact)
2. **Was it hard?** (Speed/Velocity)


### Using VelocityGrid for PostHog Interview Prep

**Why this matters for your interview:**

PostHog's PM philosophy emphasizes **context-setting over roadmap dictation**. The VelocityGrid is a perfect example of how you'd provide that context to autonomous engineering teams:

1. **Retrospective Tool:** After a sprint/quarter, map shipped features to identify patterns
2. **Strategic Communication:** Show engineering teams visually where they're spending effort vs. creating value
3. **Prioritization Framework:** Before committing to a feature, ask "Which quadrant will this land in?"
4. **Culture Alignment:** PostHog values "bias for action" + "customer obsession" — VelocityGrid measures both (speed + impact)

**Connection to PostHog Metrics:**

VelocityGrid **Impact Scores** can be tied directly to PostHog's AARRR metrics:

- **10 (Game-changer):** Feature that improved activation rate by 10%+ or retention by 15%+
- **7-8 (Significant):** Feature that moved a key metric by 5-10%
- **4-6 (Moderate):** Feature used by activated users but didn't change macro metrics
- **1-3 (Negligible):** Feature with <5% adoption or no measurable impact

## Final Advice

**PostHog values:**
1. **Bias for action** - Ship fast, iterate, learn
2. **Transparency** - Open source, public handbook, honest communication
3. **Customer obsession** - 1 interview/week/PM rule exists for a reason

5. **Autonomy** - Small teams, minimal process, trust over control

**Your interview prep should reflect these values:**
- Show you've done deep research (transparency = you can see their whole handbook)
- Demonstrate customer empathy (talk about jobs-to-be-done, not just features)
- Think like a product engineer (technical depth, not just business acumen)
- Focus on outcomes, not process (what got achieved, not how many meetings)
- Use frameworks like VelocityGrid to show you think about impact AND velocity
